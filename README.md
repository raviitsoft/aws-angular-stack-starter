# AWS Angular Stack Automation

## Introduction
This starter project shows how to create the hosting infrastructure for an Angular app using CloudFormation and how to deploy the app using the CLI.

### Prerequisites
* Amazon Route53 Domain
* Amazon Certificate Manager cert for the domain

## Deploy the stack

Run the following command from the /stack directory:  
(replace asterisks with your own values)

`aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yml --stack-name aws-ng-demo --parameter-overrides BaseUrl=*** AppUrl=*** AcmCertArn=***`

Get the CloudFront DistributionId and S3 bucket by running the following command  
(you can also get this from the web console)

```aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name aws-ng-demo --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`DistributionId` || OutputKey==`AppBucket`]"```

## Deploy the App

1. Update /demo-app/package.json/scripts/deploy  
Replace {AppBucket} & {DistributionId} with your stack outputs
2. Run the following command from the /demo-app directory  
`npm run deploy`

Congratulations! You have deploy the infrastructure and code for an angular app entirely from console. Now drop this into CodePipeline & CodeBuild to get your CI/CD pipeline started.
